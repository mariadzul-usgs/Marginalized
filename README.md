# Capture Recapture, Occupancy, and Integrated Population Models using Marginalization

### We illistrate the advantages of marginalization using six examples:



- Application 1: Cormack Jolly Seber (CJS) models fit to Rainbow Trout data.
- Application 2: Dynamic Two Species Occupancy Models - Owls.
- Application 3: Combination Occupancy - N-Mixture Models - Owls.
- Application 4: Multi-State capture Recapture models fit to Humpback Chub data.
- Application 5: Dynamic Community Occupancy Models - Sky Islands.
- Application 6: Integrated Population Models (IPM) fit to Brown Trout data.
