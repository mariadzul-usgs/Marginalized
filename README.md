# Capture Recapture, Occupancy, and Integrated Population Models using Marginalization

### We illistrate the advantages of marginalization using six examples:


- Application 1: Cormack Jolly Seber Models - Rainbow Trout 
- Application 2: Multi-State Capture Recapture Models - Humpback Chub
- Application 3: Dynamic Community Occupancy Models - Sky Islands
- Application 4: Integrated Population Models - Brown Trout
- Application 5: Dynamic Two Species Occupancy Models - Owls
