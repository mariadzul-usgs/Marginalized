# Capture Recapture, Occupancy, and Integrated Population Models using Marginalization

(marginalized repo isn't working :confused:, so use this one for now)

### We illistrate the advantages of marginalization using six examples:

1. Cormack Jolly Seber (CJS) models fit to Rainbow Trout data.
2. Multi-State capture Recapture models fit to Humpback Chub Data.
3. Integrated Population Models (IPM) fit to Brown Trout data.
4. Community Occupancy Models.
5. Combination Occupancy - N-Mixture Models.
6. Dynamic Two Species Occupancy Models.
